  A <strong>superhero</strong> (sometimes rendered <strong>super-hero</strong> or <strong>super hero</strong>) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a <strong>superheroine</strong> (also rendered <strong>super-heroine</strong> or <strong>super heroine</strong>), although the word superhero is commonly used for females also. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s.
